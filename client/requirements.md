## Packages
framer-motion | Essential for soft, slow animations (fade-in, floating elements)
lucide-react | For subtle icons if needed (though mostly custom shapes/text)

## Notes
- Font requirement: Arabic Google Fonts (Cairo, Amiri, El Messiri)
- RTL layout direction is critical for Arabic content
- No user interaction required (static/decorative page)
